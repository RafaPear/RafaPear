**Computer Science and Engineering Student @ ISEL (4th semester)**  
Lisbon, Portugal · 20 years old

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student based in Lisbon, currently completing my degree at ISEL.  
My main interests lie in understanding how software works from the ground up — from low-level programs and rendering pipelines to compilers and language tooling.

I enjoy working close to the machine, but I am not allergic to higher-level abstractions when they are well designed.  
My goal right now is simple: learn as much as possible, improve my technical skills, and finish the degree properly (without cutting corners).

## Background

Before engineering, I followed a professional secondary education path at **EPI – Escola Profissional de Imagem**, where I studied **Music Production and Technologies (PTM)**.  
During that time, I completed internships at:

- **Namouche Studios** (Lisbon)
- **Sound Station Studios** (Campo de Ourique)

That background gave me a strong technical mindset outside of software: signal flow, tooling, discipline, and attention to detail.  
I still actively produce electronic music and play **guitar, bass, and keyboards** — which probably explains my interest in systems, pipelines, and things that need to *actually work*.

## Technical Profile

I see myself as a mix of:
- systems engineer  
- compiler / language tooling enthusiast  
- generalist with strong low-level interests  

Things I genuinely enjoy:
- compilers and language internals  
- low-level programming  
- rendering and graphics pipelines  

Things I actively avoid:
- frontend-heavy work  

## Focus Areas

- **Systems Programming:** C, low-level design, understanding execution models  
- **Language Engineering:** lexers, compilers, tooling, APIs that don’t lie  
- **Rendering & Graphics:** pipelines, transformations, implementation from scratch  
- **Software Design:** CLI tools, build systems, maintainable architectures  

## Featured Projects

### Independent

| Project | Description | Tech |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **[KPB](https://github.com/RafaPear/KPB)** | Kotlin build automation tool with explicit configuration and minimal magic | Kotlin, Gradle |
| **[KtFlag](https://github.com/RafaPear/KtFlag)** | Zero-dependency CLI argument parser with a minimal, predictable API | Kotlin |

| **[C3D](https://github.com/RafaPear/C3D)** | 3D graphics pipeline implemented from scratch | C |

### Academic

| Project | Course | Semester | Focus | Tech |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|------|
| **[SSnake 2.0](https://github.com/RafaPear/SSnake)** | Programming (PG) | 1 | Event-driven architecture, state management | Kotlin |
| **[IPW Assignment](https://github.com/RafaPear/IPW-2425-Assignment)** | Intro to Web Programming (IPW) | 3 | Full-stack web application | JavaScript, HTML, CSS |
| **[TDS Assignment](https://github.com/RafaPear/TDS-2425-Assignment)** | Software Dev Techniques (TDS) | 3 | Design patterns, testing, architecture | Kotlin |

> The **TDS project** is the academic work I am most proud of, as it best represents how I think about structure, design, and long-term maintainability.

## Looking Ahead

In the next few years, I am open to:
- internships  
- full-time work  
- a master’s degree  
- or a combination of all three  

I am particularly interested in environments where I can keep learning, work close to the fundamentals, and contribute to meaningful technical systems.
